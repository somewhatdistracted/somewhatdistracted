- 👀 I’m interested in hardware design, game development, and lasers!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data compression! Check out Stanford's data compression library - we're using it for EE274!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to take on more projects at the moment, but I love to hear about new cool stuff!
- 📫 How to reach me - why would you want to do that?
