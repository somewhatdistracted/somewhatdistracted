ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ian MacFarlane (@somewhatdistracted), a recently-graduated Electrical Engineering BS/MS student at Stanford and general nerd.

Who am I?
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a huge range of stuff across CS/EE, but recently I've been focusing on digital chip design (check out [OpenEnclave](https://github.com/somewhatdistracted/OpenEnclave)), power electronics, and photonics. I also played a lot of games growing up, so you might see a lot of game related projects here (or checkout my friend JD's repo for the [smash bros AI](https://github.com/jdkelly199/libmelee-openai-gym) we tried to put together). Other cool stuff I've done includes iNSYNC (link coming, have to sanitize a public version of the repo), the hardware device / app that lets you play music over multiple bluetooth speakers that some friends and I put together in Winter 2022.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data compression! Check out Stanford's [data compression library](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library) - we're using it for EE274!
- ðŸ“– I'm a huge reader (especially Sci-Fi/Fantasy), so I feel a moral obligation to throw out some book recs! Here's [one](https://www.goodreads.com/series/265443-the-wandering-inn)! And [another](https://www.goodreads.com/series/231285-the-sun-eater)! [These](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle) things practically [fall](https://www.goodreads.com/series/336405-mother-of-learning) out of the [sky](https://www.goodreads.com/series/99602-powder-mage)!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - feel free to connect on LinkedIn? I don't like listing my info everywhere, however easy it would be to buy it off a harvested list somewhere.
